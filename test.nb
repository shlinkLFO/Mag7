## Final Project Grading Rubric  (60 points)

### Define the question (10 points)

-   Specific data questions to be answered by the end of the project have \
been clearly defined. 

### Get data (10 points)

-   The data source has been clearly identified. Either the link to a \
publicly accessible source or the data file itself has been included. If I am \
 unable to run the code in the notebook for lack of access to the data, I \
cannot proceed with the grading.

-   Data has been cleaned and any errors and missing data have been dealt with.

### Visualize data and explore data (10 points)

-   Visualizations of the data has been performed, including:

        -    At least three types of data such as numbers, websites, texts, \
images, audio.

        -   At least one visualization about time, one visualization about \
place, and once visualization about price.

-   Simple visualizations should be used whenever possible to illustrate the \
topic and add visual interest.

-   Exploratory data analysis has been performed, including but not limited \
to correlation, regression, machine learning.

Conclusions from the exploratory analysis have been clearly explained.

-   The final results of the analysis must include at least one or more of \
the following: 

    -   An infographic (either static or interactive) such as a poster that \
conveys the results succinctly, without need for accompanying verbal \
explanation.

    -   A data product or app run locally on the desktop in a Wolfram \
Notebook or online through the Wolfram Cloud that performs data analysis \
according to the model developed in this project. (Optional) 

### Code is interpretable (10 points)

-   Clearly defined sections/steps for data analysis have been provided.

-    Variable and function names should have a clear relationship to their \
purpose in the code. 

-   Relevant, concise text explanations should be included to describe every \
stage of the project workflow.

-   Code should include comments to explain exactly what is being done by the \
code. Use comments in the following format:\

Cell["Null", "Input",ExpressionUUID->"b4285e7a-73ad-46ed-ab89-de5670891445"],

Cell["\<\
-   No irrelevant results, unnecessarily long display of data, or distracting \
code (experimentations) should be present in the final notebook. 

### Results are replicable (10 points)

-   Notebook should be self-contained. (It should be possible for the grader \
to run the code without any external dependency.)

-   Links to existing published research used as references for this project \
should be included.

-   If this project builds on someone else\[CloseCurlyQuote]s work or \
attempts to provide comparative analysis, it should clearly provide a \
reference to such work.

### Share your story and engage (10 points)

-   A 10-minute in-class presentation. (5 points)

-   An LinkedIn Page about your Project (5 points)

## Final Project FAQs

Q: Could we use data from Kaggle? Should the reference come from published \
research? or Naggle project is good enough?

A: Yes, Kaggle is a great data source. I would strong you include multiple \
references, and yes, I accept Naggle project as references too.



Q: For the group projects, should we find members by ourselves or will it be \
randomly assigned?

A: Please find members by yourselves within your section (8:00AM MSB, 12:30PM \
MS, 3:30PM C4)



Q: What should the infographic look like? Does it mean the poster cannot \
include any words or letters in it?

A: Infographic is just another way to say data visualization, by definition \
it is a visual image such as a chart or diagram used to represent information \
or data. N, on the contrary, infographic combines legends, labels, marks, \
numbers, images, trends. Please see the deck of slides (Source: Du & Peecher, \
MOOC, Sustainability Reporting, Copyrighted: Gies School of Business, \
University of Illinois) for some general guidance about infographics.



Q:So the deliverable is just a notebook and the data source (if any) or does \
it also need a slide deck?

A: Yes, the deliverable is just a notebook and the data source, I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need a slide deck, but if you could print the notebook as \
a PDF file, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll make my grading easier.



Q: For the final project, can we work on data related to the ... of the \
immigrants from the Middle East? Do we have a proper source for that ? 

A: You can use Perplexity.AI for finding data sources. It is better for \
research purposes and can be use as a supplement in addition to OpenAI\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ChatGPT. This URL might be helpful

https://www.perplexity.ai/

https://cis.org/Report/Immigrants-Middle-East



Q: What are the things I need to focus on while working on the project.

A: First, start with finding group members who share similar interests. \
Second, use group discussion time to decide on question/data you\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll work on. Third, submit your work for checkpoint-1, -2, \
-3, so that you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have sufficient opportunities to obtain \
feedback from the instructor.



Q: Are there previous projects that I can refer to?

A: I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll show some in the beginning of the next class.



Q: Should we focus on specific functions or algorithms?

A: Some of my favorable functions are Table, Manipulate, CountryData, \
FinancialData, CityData, GeolistPlot, WebDeploy... But feel free to use your \
own creativity!



Q: Can we use other tools of languages to help processing data?

A: you surely can. As long as you import the final data to Mathematica for \
visualization, exploration, and web deploy.



Q: Is it ok if we reference some code from another source?

A: you surely can. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll talk about some notebook examples in \
Wolfram Mathematica environment. Feel free to build your work based on \
others, as long as you cite properly.



Q: Will the project checkpoints contribute to the score?

A: Not officially but my observation is that groups who submit project \
checkpoints on time usually perform better for the submissions for the final \
projects.



Q: Can we use virtual data if some data parts of the project is missing? Or \
we cannot find it on the internet?

A: This is a hard question! I strongly strongly encourage you use the real \
data. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hard for me to answer this one without more \
contextual understanding about the particular data items you have in mind.



Q: I worry I could not find a teammate.

A: Give it a try. TAs will help students find groups if there remains team \
matching need at the end of October.



Q: Do we have presentations for the final project?

A: I will arrange final presentations for the final project, the grading will \
consider the quality of your submitted notebook anas well as your presentation.



Q: Can we use the same topic and data from another course?

A: You can use the same data, but the focus of my final project is for data \
story-telling.
